          <p class="bio">
            I grew up in Seattle, WA.  I lived in Atlanta, Denver and the Bay Area for eight years before moving back to Seattle in 2014.  I was an accountant and consultant at <a href="http://www.pwc.com/"> PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</a> before joining <a href="http://Code.Builders" target="_blank">Code Builders</a> to become a developer.

            I believe in the continuous development of self and I am always trying to learn something new.  In my free time, I explore the Pacific Northwest and take pictures with my girlfriend, <a href ="https://twitter.com/callapatel" target="_blank">Calla</a>, and my dog, Pawpea.
